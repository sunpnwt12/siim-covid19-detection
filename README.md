This is my repository for attending kaggle SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19 Detection

## Evaluation

> The challenge uses the standard PASCAL VOC 2010 mean Average Precision (mAP) at IoU > 0.5. Note that the linked document describes VOC 2012, which differs in some minor ways (e.g. there is no concept of "difficult" classes in VOC 2010). The P/R curve and AP calculations remain the same. In this competition, we are making predictions at both a study (multi-image) and image level.
